I've been been privileged to be a computer science peer educator in a few forms: 
* as a Summer Immersion teaching assistant for [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) in Summer 2017.
* a lead instructor for the forth-grade classroom of [Science Club for Girls](https://www.scienceclubforgirls.org/), during the 2017-18 school year. Through an independent study at Wellesley, one of the program co-coordinators and I developed a new computer science & logic [curriculum](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12uUDcS2lzqGUasc7SHM_iddRvCu_CouqUrGGpwEONYI/edit?usp=sharing) for Wellesley's sister organization 
* and a Supplemental Instruction (recitation) leader (and formerly tutor) for [Data Structures](https://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs230/) at Wellesley, since August 2017. As an SI, I create worksheets to review data structures topics -- feel free to use [them](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AqZUX2DnbirPe9qpzD7cOz8_-1nohemv?usp=sharing), just request Google Drive access. Please note that I often adapt/reuse iterations from previous Wellesley SIs and credit should frequently be directed to them as noted in worksheet headers.
