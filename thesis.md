In my senior year at Wellesley, I wrote an Honors Thesis (_Proactive Protections for Smartphone
Users' Personal Data in the Mobile Ecosystem_) under the advisement of Prof. Ada Lerner. The thesis itself is under embargo until May 2022, but if you're interested in learning more please send me an email and I'd be happy to discuss.

The following are archival links for the work that may not be active until May 2022:
