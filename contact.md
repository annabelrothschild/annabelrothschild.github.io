The easiest way to reach me is over email, at my-first-initial and my-last-initial  @annabelrothschild.com, where "my-first-initial and my-last-initial" resolves to "ar". You can find my PGP key [here](https://annabelrothschild.com/key.txt).

You can also use my institutional affiliation email (arothschild at gatech dot edu), but I am much more likely to miss emails from non-US domains there, thanks to some kink in the filtering. Emailing both my independent and institutional addresses is probably a good idea if you have a non-US ISO code (I'm very sorry for the hassle and much look forward to your email!).
