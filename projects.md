# Past Projects

#### Proactive Privacy Protections for Smartphone Users

I spent my senior year at Wellesley working on [thesis](https://annabelrothschild.com/undergraduate/thesis) under the supervision of [Prof. Ada Lerner](https://adalerner.com/). My goal was to synthesize existing work on protecting smartphone user data and to try to figure out why many of these excellent systems and tools hadn't yet been adopted. I then developed a blueprint for a proactive privacy system to address these obstacles to adoption, after designing and conducting user surveys to inform the design of such a system.

#### Newspapers on Wikipedia (#NOW) Project

I worked with [Prof. Eni Mustafaraj](https://cs.wellesley.edu/~eni/) of Wellesley in the [Cred Lab](https://cs.wellesley.edu/~credlab/), focusing on misinformation on the web, for much of my undergraduate experience. One of the projects I worked on (inspired by my lab-mate [Emma Lurie's](https://emmalurie.github.io/) [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3201064.3201095)) was the [NOW project](https://hapgood.us/newspapers-on-wikipedia-charity-challenge/) led by [Mike Caulfield](https://hapgood.us/). Through the project, we hoped to increase the visibility of legitimate local newspapers on the Web.

The project was covered by Wellesley College's [Daily Shot](https://www.wellesley.edu/news/2018/stories/node/161316) and resulted in a paper at 2019 Computation + Journalism symposium.

#### FeelsLike

In Summer 2019, I worked in the HCI lab of [Prof. Dr. Susanne Boll](https://uol.de/en/susanne-boll/) of the University of Oldenburg, as part of the [IRES Ubicomp program](http://hciunh.org/hci-ubicomp-ires/) co-directed by Dr. Andrew Kun of UNH and Dr. Orit Shaer of Wellesley. I was supervised by [Prof. Dr. Torben Wallbaum](http://torbenwallbaum.com/) and built _[FeelsLike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_j0_baWfU4)_ to help long distance partners share significant emotional moments. I continue to work on the development of _FeelsLike_ through present day.

I worked with [Prof. Yanni Loukisass](http://loukissas.lmc.gatech.edu/) of Georgia Tech on the [Atlanta Map Room](http://loukissas.lmc.gatech.edu/uncategorized/atlanta-map-room/), where we sought to make data about gentrification more tangible and empower Atlantans to add missing context to presented data. Tech's news team wrote up a nice article about the Civic Data REU [here](http://ideas.gatech.edu/fifth-summer-civic-data-science-program-presents-community-focused-solutions), and here's a [link](https://www.atlantastudies.org/2018/12/04/local-data-design-lab-the-atlanta-map-room/) to a post we wrote for the _Atlanta Studies Blog_ about the project.
