Mostly I keep this record as a list of inspirations, but in no particular order:

* [Hilma af Klint](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/feb/21/hilma-af-klint-occult-spiritualism-abstract-serpentine-gallery).
* W.E.B. Du Bois' (and his teams') [visionary infographics](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/first-time-together-and-color-book-displays-web-du-bois-visionary-infographics-180970826/)
* [Fatima al-Fihri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatima_al-Fihri) founded the oldest university in the world, the [University of al-Qarawiyyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_al-Qarawiyyin) in 859 CE which is wild to think about. 
* [Mimi Ọnụọha](http://mimionuoha.com/) is! so! cool! Hearing her speak at [an event at Wellesley](https://www.wellesley.edu/events/node/165126) was super amazing and an experience I'm very grateful for.
* A [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b4cDkUNv59Sx2YreUmtkWTHjf9dgUh66aYrOeg7YoUA/edit#gid=0) of programming langauges (co)created by women, put together by [Dr. Chris Martens](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/people/crmarten).
* [Carrie Mae Weems](http://carriemaeweems.net/work.html) produces such brilliant, thought-provoking (and beautiful) work on a variety of important, pressing topics.
* [_I Was Raised on the Internet_](https://mcachicago.org/Exhibitions/2018/I-Was-Raised-On-The-Internet) is perhaps one of the best exhibitions I've ever had the chance to see. 
* I hope to one day see _[Radical Women: Latin American Art, 1960–1985](https://www.artsy.net/show/hammer-museum-radical-women-latin-american-art-1960-1985)_ in its entirety. Graciela Carnevale, Cecilia Vicunã, and Nelbia Romero amaze me with their ability to communicate such hefty messages through their respective visual mediums.
* I find [Kathë Kollwitz's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A4the_Kollwitz) work eternally poignant, too. 
* [Tove Jansson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tove_Jansson) is another long time inspiration. 
* An excellent book about life in academia: [Dr. Hope Jahren's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_Girl).
* Cindy Sherman's [Untitled Film Stills](https://artlead.net/content/journal/modern-classics-cindy-sherman-untitled-film-stills/). I do grapple, however, with the tableaus in some of her other work (and the experiences they represent -- or perhaps appropriate or mock might be better words).
* I admire the way [Yael Bartana](http://yaelbartana.com/biography) expresses her politics through art.
* [hana vu](https://hanavu.bandcamp.com/) makes cool music.
