# Interests
Broadly, I am intirgued by the question: how do we make the field of computer science more accessible and our CS education systems more effective, so that our future systems are developed by individuals with a diverse set of voices and backgrounds? I'm interested by the many subfields of CS that have the potential for positive impact related to this question:
* HCI: to make sure our technologies are both accessible and usable
* data science: as the need for data de-mystification systems seems immense
* security & data mangagement: to make sure we're doing it all safely and sustainably 

# Experience
I currently work with [Prof. Eni Mustafaraj](https://cs.wellesley.edu/~eni/) of Wellesley in the [Cred Lab](https://cs.wellesley.edu/~credlab/), where we study minsinformation on the web. I've also worked with [Prof. Yanni Loukisass](http://loukissas.lmc.gatech.edu/) of Georgia Tech on the [Atlanta Map Room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EkI9Oav49c), where we sought to make data about gentrification more tangible and empower Atlantans to add missing context to presented data. For Summer 2019, I'm very excited to be working in the HCI lab of [Prof. Dr. Susanne Boll](https://uol.de/en/susanne-boll/) of the University of Oldenburg; I'll be doing this as a member of the [IRES Ubicomp program](http://hciunh.org/hci-ubicomp-ires/) co-directed by Dr. Andrew Kun of UNH and Dr. Orit Shaer of Wellesley. Starting this Fall, I will be embarking on an independent study/thesis with [Prof. Ada Lerner](https://www.wellesley.edu/cs/faculty/lerner) of Wellesley about security and npm.
