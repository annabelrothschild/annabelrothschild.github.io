I use Google Analytics (GA) on this site, despite my protestations against invasive data collection practices. Which is probably hypocritical to the n-th degree. However, the reason for this is that I use this website like a business card, except in many cases I'm not able to directly meet those individuals who visit the website. For that reason, I find it helpful to know pieces of information are most useful -- for example, PDFs of papers maybe? 

Anyway, you don't have to opt-in to having your data collected (i.e., you might lose the business card in your satchel as I always accidentally do), as you have a right to autonomy with your data. For this reason, __GA should not be activated unless you click to approve the banner message__. At least, this is true in the many trials I've done; you should let me know if you find otherwise (email in footer). Long term, I would like to use one of the other, more privacy-respecting analytics services out there, but the honest answer is that I'm not paying a squigillion dollars a year to do so on a grad student budget. So for now, we make do with this.

Finally, if you find you accidentally misclick to approve and would like to rescind your approval, try a "hard refresh" (specific to your browser) and the message should pop up again. Of course, this does not delete your entry from GA, which I can attempt manually if you let me know.

(Real finally:) There is a YouTube video embedded in my projects page. I cannot figure out a way to disable tracking from it (I don't 'own' the video in my account), so you may see that tracker appear. Apologies.
