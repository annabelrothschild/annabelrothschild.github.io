We're starting a student-run reading group for Wellesley CS students! Join us!

Purpose: to discuss interesting research papers in any subfield of computer science (or any applied computer science discipline). If you’re interested in joining us (or helping organize this group), please email me: arothsch [@] wellesley [.] edu. Information about leading a session can be found at the link at the bottom of the page -- we welcome discussion leaders who have a passion for a particular topic and a scholarly article to center the discussion around. No formal expertise is required to be a discussion leader; we're all figuring out how to grapple effectively with technical language and writing, so the atmosphere should be welcoming and supportive. We're here to ask questions and help each other find answers, not present polished "conference" style talks.

No formal background or expertise is required to join; we hope to gather students from various grade/course levels and backgrounds. The goal of this group is to gain experience in reading research papers and discuss interesting technical innovations. 

Reasons to join us:
1. Exposure to deciphering technical papers — whether you want to get involved with CS research or need it for a class, it’s a worthwhile skill. 
2. Meet other CS students! This will be a fun, informal environment to hang out with other CS-minded folks and discuss interesting topics. 
3. Learn what other fields and applications of CS are out there. 
4. …become intrigued by CS research opportunities — but please still join us even if you are more interested in the applied and/or professional side of CS (such as software engineering), we promise this will still be a useful and enjoyable experience.

Questions or interested in helping organize this group? Please feel free to email me directly.
