# Research News

* May 2020: I successfully defended my honors thesis! Thanks so much to everyone who came, it was so much fun to have you all there.
* September 2019: a [review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2019-09-30/Recent_research) of our C+J 2019 paper was published in The Signpost, the online newspaper of the English-language Wikipedia.

# Research Statement

At a high level, I'm interested in helping individuals reason about the socio-technical systems they interact with. One manifestation of this is computing education; I am especially passionate about its applications in informal contexts (essentially anything outside a traditional, structured class). I'm also excited about projects that promote data literacy and help individuals build on their existing data-evaluation skills. I strongly reject the notion that there are computer scientists and everyone else; instead, I think every individual already understands the underlying logic of programming (they use those same skills to make their way through everyday life), it's just a matter of finding the most effective ways to help them translate that into code.

I also have a secondary interest in the role of programming languages in computing education. I’m curious about the effects of primarily teaching programming using PLs derived almost exclusively from English. Moreover, I’d like to do work on understanding whether or not a programming course can be more accessible and/or effective if the PL syntax is derived from a language that might be more comfortable or familiar to a given individual than English. 


# Experience

My research experiences span a few fields – information science, human-computer interaction, and privacy & security. I'm grateful to have had experience in these various fields as it's allowed me to learn the ever-useful core methods of each.

I most recently completed an honors [thesis](https://annabelrothschild.com/undergraduate/thesis) (bachelorarbeit) with [Prof. Ada Lerner](https://www.wellesley.edu/cs/faculty/lerner) of Wellesley. The topics is "Helping Users Understand and Prevent Data Exfiltration by Ads in Android Apps".

I worked with [Prof. Eni Mustafaraj](https://cs.wellesley.edu/~eni/) of Wellesley in the [Cred Lab](https://cs.wellesley.edu/~credlab/), whose members study minsinformation on the web, for much of my undergraduate experience. One of our projects was covered by Wellesley College's [Daily Shot](https://www.wellesley.edu/news/2018/stories/node/161316). 

In Summer 2019, I worked in the HCI lab of [Prof. Dr. Susanne Boll](https://uol.de/en/susanne-boll/) of the University of Oldenburg, as part of the [IRES Ubicomp program](http://hciunh.org/hci-ubicomp-ires/) co-directed by Dr. Andrew Kun of UNH and Dr. Orit Shaer of Wellesley. I was supervised by [Prof. Dr. Torben Wallbaum](http://torbenwallbaum.com/) and built _[FeelsLike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_j0_baWfU4)_ to help long distance partners share significant emotional moments. I continue to work on the development of _FeelsLike_ through present day.

I've also worked with [Prof. Yanni Loukisass](http://loukissas.lmc.gatech.edu/) of Georgia Tech on the [Atlanta Map Room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EkI9Oav49c), where we sought to make data about gentrification more tangible and empower Atlantans to add missing context to presented data. Tech's news team wrote up a nice article about the Civic Data REU [here](http://ideas.gatech.edu/fifth-summer-civic-data-science-program-presents-community-focused-solutions).
