# About the project

<img style="padding-left: 15px;padding-bottom: 15px" align="right" width="100%" src="images/gnat-catcher.png">

A low-cost electronic fungus gnat catcher. The catcher has two settings:
 *  User can turn the catcher on at any time by pressing a push-button, which controls one set of yellow lights (LEDs)
 *  The catcher will turn on automatically in low light settings (say, nighttime) and off in high light settings (during the day) -- this feature controls a second, independent set of white lights (LEDs)
