Hello, 

I'm an incoming first year student in Georgia Tech's Human-Centered Computing PhD program. I recieved my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at [Wellesley College](https://www.wellesley.edu/cs), with a minor in Math. My pronouns are [she/her](https://pronoun.is/she).

My research interests broadly center around computer science education and increasing computing literacy; my [research page](https://annabelrothschild.com/research/) has more information. I also enjoy actively [teaching CS](https://annabelrothschild.com/teaching/).

I'm also interested in widening participation in computing and computing research. I try to share things I've learned (often sourced from a host of mentors and more experienced friends I'm lucky to have) on [my blog](https://medium.com/me/stories/public). If something I've done or am working on is interesting to you, or you just want someone to discuss your interest in research with, please feel free to email me.

Outside of computer science, I enjoy hiking, biking, and [cool art](https://annabelrothschild.com/personal/art/). My first language is English, my French is B2/C1, my German & Swedish are terrible but in progress -- A2 at best (these are [CEFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages) scores).
