If you're perhaps not used to the [Telemediengesetz](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemediengesetz) ([English explanation](https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/impressum/)), it requires "German websites" to list the author(s) and their information. I think the closest thing you might encounter in the US, for example, is a "site notice" or something that would direct you to the terms of use.
