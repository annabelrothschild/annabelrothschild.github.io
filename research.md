# Interests
Broadly, I am intirgued by the question: how do we make the field of computer science more accessible and our computer science education systems more effective? We need our future systems to be developed by individuals with a diverse set of voices and backgrounds. I'm interested by the many subfields of CS that have the potential for positive impact related to this question:
* HCI: to make sure our technologies are both accessible and usable -- that we build systems that are inclusive and avaliable to all
* data science: I think the need for data de-mysitifcation systems is immense; we need to be building systems that track even change to data from collection to presentation to the wider public, so that folks can understand the knowledge they're being presented with (and any limitations thereof)
* programming languages: what is the effect of a programming language on a CS student's learning outcome? How can we build languages to fit more naturally into existing grammatical models already familiar to students?  
* security & data mangagement: to make sure we're doing it all safely and sustainably, of course, but also to ensure the political neutrality of the resources we build 

# Experience
I currently work with [Prof. Eni Mustafaraj](https://cs.wellesley.edu/~eni/) of Wellesley in the [Cred Lab](https://cs.wellesley.edu/~credlab/), where we study minsinformation on the web. One of our projects was recently covered by Wellesley College's [Daily Shot](https://www.wellesley.edu/news/2018/stories/node/161316). 

I've also worked with [Prof. Yanni Loukisass](http://loukissas.lmc.gatech.edu/) of Georgia Tech on the [Atlanta Map Room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EkI9Oav49c), where we sought to make data about gentrification more tangible and empower Atlantans to add missing context to presented data. GaTech wrote up a nice article about the Civic Data REU [here](http://ideas.gatech.edu/fifth-summer-civic-data-science-program-presents-community-focused-solutions).

For Summer 2019, I'm very excited to be working in the HCI lab of [Prof. Dr. Susanne Boll](https://uol.de/en/susanne-boll/) of the University of Oldenburg; I'll be doing this as a member of the [IRES Ubicomp program](http://hciunh.org/hci-ubicomp-ires/) co-directed by Dr. Andrew Kun of UNH and Dr. Orit Shaer of Wellesley. 

Starting this Fall, I will be embarking on an independent study/thesis with [Prof. Ada Lerner](https://www.wellesley.edu/cs/faculty/lerner) of Wellesley about security (focusing on community package repositories).
