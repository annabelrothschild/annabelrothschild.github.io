I am a human-centered computing PhD student at Georgia Tech, from August 2020, where I am member of the [DataWorks](https://dataworkforce.gatech.edu/) research team. Before that, I studied CS at [Wellesley College](https://www.wellesley.edu/cs). A current(ish) copy of my cv is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17xsQWARRODKBcnFjARglB1-IYF9KlgqcIHPTYt-Yz5A/edit?usp=sharing) and my pronouns are she/her.

Data work is the focus of my research; I investigate who performs it and how they go about it. My approach is informed by critical data studies and a desire to preserve the social context in which a dataset was promulgated (the "who, what, where, when, why, how"). My current projects center the labor context of digital piecework platforms (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk) and the impacts of de-professionalization and task atomization on both individuals and the data they work with. I am also interested in building software systems and tools that support environmental documentation with minimal effort invasiveness. 

Here is a kind of ["informal" bibliography](https://annabelrothschild.com/books) of books that have broadened (and/or challenged) my views on human agents in data-intensive systems and explains my perspective on data and computaitonal systems. I also pull from prior experience (and continued interest) in programming languages, usable security and privacy, and information dissemination in modern media.

Not entirely unrelated to my research, I also care quite a bit about data privacy in contemporary society. I keep a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eyy-YyFMA6gLla9F999hdHuxJlFO5M7G5hC9KW5bLS0/edit?usp=sharing) of the temporal and financial cost of protecting just my own personal information to record the priviledge of being able to proactively do so.
