# Hello! Hej! 
I'm a Computer Science ~~enthusiast~~ student at [Wellesley College](https://www.wellesley.edu/cs). My research page has a bit more info about the kinds of projects I most enjoy. 

# For Wellesley Students
I'm happy to chat with non-Wellesley students about any of the following, but some are Wellesley-speific, thus the heading. Either way, email is the best way to reach me.
* Albright Fellowship
* Supplemental Instruction (SI) Leader or Tutoring in the Wellesley CS department
* Wellesley CS major/being a CS major at a liberal arts college (spoiler: it's great!)
* REUs (research experiences for undergraduates, funded by the National Science Foundation)
* Undergraduate computer science research

# Other Interests
* Hiking -- particularly in the mountains of the Southeastern US, for example, goofing around in [Pisgah National Forest](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W6abSyLooI3kTHoX4csT8yu4fn54cAtq/view?usp=sharing)
* Green things, such as those found in my dorm room ["farm"](/images/IMG_4301.JPG)
* Genre-bending artists and works, like [Hilma af Klint](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/feb/21/hilma-af-klint-occult-spiritualism-abstract-serpentine-gallery) and Cindy Sherman's [Untitled Film Stills](https://artlead.net/content/journal/modern-classics-cindy-sherman-untitled-film-stills/)
