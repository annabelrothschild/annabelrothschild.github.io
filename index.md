Hello, 

I'm an incoming first year student in Georgia Tech's Human-Centered Computing PhD program. I recieved my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at [Wellesley College](https://www.wellesley.edu/cs), with a minor in Mathematics.

My research interests broadly center around computer science education and increasing computing literacy; my [research page](https://annabelrothschild.com/research/) has more information. I also enjoy actively [teaching CS](https://annabelrothschild.com/teaching/).

Outside of computer science, I enjoy hiking and [cool art](https://annabelrothschild.com/personal/art/). My first language is English, my French is B2/C1, my German & Swedish are terrible but in progress -- A2 at best (these are [CEFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages) scores).
