I am a PhD student at Georgia Tech, from August 2020. Before that, I studied CS at [Wellesley College](https://www.wellesley.edu/cs). A current(ish) copy of my cv is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17xsQWARRODKBcnFjARglB1-IYF9KlgqcIHPTYt-Yz5A/edit?usp=sharing).

My research centers around data work; who performs it, how it happens, and more fundamentally, what we consider the term to mean.
