# Interests
Broadly, I am intirgued by the question: how do we make the field of computer science more accessible and our computer science education systems more effective? We need our future systems to be developed by individuals with a diverse set of voices and backgrounds. Further, I think that in order to be an enfranchised member of our increasingly digitized society, an individual has a right to exposure to computing. I'm interested by the many subfields of CS that have the potential for positive impact related to this topic:
* HCI: how do we make sure our technologies are both accessible and usable? How do we build a system that is accessible to all?
* data science: how can we reframe data summaries and visualizations to encourage questions, rather than acceptance? 
* programming languages: what is the effect of a programming language on a CS student's learning outcome? How can we build languages to fit more naturally into existing grammatical models already familiar to students?  
* security & data mangagement: how do we preserve privacy in the systems we build to achieve this goal?

# Experience
I currently work with [Prof. Eni Mustafaraj](https://cs.wellesley.edu/~eni/) of Wellesley in the [Cred Lab](https://cs.wellesley.edu/~credlab/), where we study minsinformation on the web. One of our projects was recently covered by Wellesley College's [Daily Shot](https://www.wellesley.edu/news/2018/stories/node/161316). 

I've also worked with [Prof. Yanni Loukisass](http://loukissas.lmc.gatech.edu/) of Georgia Tech on the [Atlanta Map Room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EkI9Oav49c), where we sought to make data about gentrification more tangible and empower Atlantans to add missing context to presented data. GaTech wrote up a nice article about the Civic Data REU [here](http://ideas.gatech.edu/fifth-summer-civic-data-science-program-presents-community-focused-solutions).

In Summer 2019, I worked in the HCI lab of [Prof. Dr. Susanne Boll](https://uol.de/en/susanne-boll/) of the University of Oldenburg, as part of the [IRES Ubicomp program](http://hciunh.org/hci-ubicomp-ires/) co-directed by Dr. Andrew Kun of UNH and Dr. Orit Shaer of Wellesley. I was supervised by [Dr. Torben Wallbaum](http://torbenwallbaum.com/) and built [FeelsLike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_j0_baWfU4) to help long distance partners share significant emotional moments. 

I am currently working on an honors thesis (bachelorarbeit) with [Prof. Ada Lerner](https://www.wellesley.edu/cs/faculty/lerner) of Wellesley. The working title of my thesis is "Helping Users Understand and Prevent Data Exfiltration by Ads in Android Apps".
