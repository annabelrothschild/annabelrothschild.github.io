Please note that my last name is spelled "Roth[__s__]child" (the "s" is silent when spoken in English, i.e. roth-child, as the German "sch" is condensed to a hard "ch" in English). Either pronunciation is fine, but when spelling it, please always includes the "s". 

This is because the "s" signifies a specific cultural and ethnic identity that is distinct from the unrelated Danish "Rothchild" lineage. The Danes are lovely, but I'm just not one; as part of American assimilation practices for refugees in the mid-20th century, my family was almost forced to remove the "s" as a part of a clarified "Americanized" spelling. However, the "s" speaks  of the survival despite persecuted and I am protective of it as such. 

Finally, if you feel a need to ask if I am responsible for the illuminati, space lasers, or any other idiotic Internet conspiracy theory or Marjorie Taylor-Greene manifesto, the answer is: Yes. You should be very scared of my imminent scorn indeed.
