I am a PhD student at Georgia Tech, from August 2020. Before that, I studied CS at [Wellesley College](https://www.wellesley.edu/cs). A current(ish) copy of my cv is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17xsQWARRODKBcnFjARglB1-IYF9KlgqcIHPTYt-Yz5A/edit?usp=sharing).

My research centers around data work; who performs it, how it happens, and more fundamentally, what we consider the term to mean (at a meta level). I am a member of the [DataWorks](https://dataworkforce.gatech.edu/) research team.

I care quite a bit about data privacy. I keep a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eyy-YyFMA6gLla9F999hdHuxJlFO5M7G5hC9KW5bLS0/edit?usp=sharing) of the temporal + financial cost of protecting just my own personal information.
