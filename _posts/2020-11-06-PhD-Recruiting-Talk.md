As part of the larger "PhD Recruiting" event, I'm speaking on a panel with some other super cool folks about the PhD experience and how we arrived at our current positions. The whole event is geared towards students both interested in a PhD and those who aren't sure if it's the right choice for them, so join us! More information, [here](https://phd-recruiting.com/).

Ps. If you didn't find out about the event in time to sign up, there are still ways for you to get involved with the community at the above link.
