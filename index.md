Hello! I'm a first year student in Georgia Tech's Human-Centered Computing PhD program. Previously, I studied CS at [Wellesley](https://www.wellesley.edu/cs). 

Currently, I'm thinking a lot about how to develop _(critical) data literacy skills_ in informal learning environments and what it means to perform _data work_.

As for vital statistics, my blood-coffee content averages somewhere around 99%.
