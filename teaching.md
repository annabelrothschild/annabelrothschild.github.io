# Interests
Broadly, I am intirgued by the question: how do we make the field of computer science more accessible and our computer science education systems more effective? We need our future systems to be developed by individuals with a diverse set of voices and backgrounds. Further, I think that in order to be an enfranchised member of our increasingly digitized society, an individual has a right to exposure to computing. I'm interested by the many subfields of CS that have the potential for positive impact related to this topic:
* HCI: how do we make sure our technologies are both accessible and usable? How do we build a system that is accessible to all?
* data science: how can we reframe data summaries and visualizations to encourage questions, rather than acceptance? 
* programming languages: what is the effect of a programming language on a CS student's learning outcome? How can we build languages to fit more naturally into existing grammatical models already familiar to students?
