Everything here is provided with the limitation that my own professional CS journey is still a work in progress (with no expiration date in sight, let's be clear), and this information is a compilation of reflections, not directions. Very far from directions, lol. I can only speak to one experience, pieces of which may or may not be useful to you -- in writing up these notes, I've tried to speak to my background and approach in the hopes that it provides clarity so you can ignore those things which aren't. One solid piece of advice I got from a professor during my undergrad was to get a bunch of advice and ignore most of it; I think that probably holds here. Treat these reflections as one piece of information to be filed in a much larger cabinet.  

Frequently, advice or suggestions are sourced from one of the many folks I've been lucky to know and/or learn from. Where applicable, I've tried to cite these individuals to the best of my memory, but absence of formal citation doesn't necessarily indicate absence of help from an advisor (formal or otherwise). Generally, I've found the following people's guidance really helpful and would advise you to check out what they've written:
* [Emma Lurie](https://emmalurie.github.io/), PhD student at the Berkeley iSchool
* [Justine Sherry](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~justine/advice.pdf), prof at CMU
* [Philip Guo](https://pg.ucsd.edu/), prof at UCSD
* [Amy J. Ko](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/cer), prof at UW, has an excellent page about computing education and careers paths in CER/CSEd generally.
* For Wellesley students, all the profs I approached were happy to talk about grad school.

Others you've found helpful? Let me know and I'll happily add them here.

_Finally, I would strongly prefer that you not copy and paste this material other places or otherwise distribute it without linking to this website; I expect things I write on this topic to change over time and I'd like to be able to centralize edits to give up-to-date information._

Feel free to contact me with any questions (contact info in the page footer). I'm also really happy to read drafts and be a sounding board, Wellesley or not. I don't care if we haven't met before -- if you're interested in a graduate degree in computing (be aware that I can speak to computing education best and more tangential fields less well) and want to talk, be in touch.
