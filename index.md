Hello! I'm a first year student in Georgia Tech's Human-Centered Computing PhD program. Previously, I studied CS at [Wellesley](https://www.wellesley.edu/cs). 

My research interests broadly center around computing education and promoting computing literacy; my [research page](https://annabelrothschild.com/research/) has more information. I also enjoy actively [teaching CS](https://annabelrothschild.com/teaching/).

Outside of computer science, I enjoy [cool art](https://annabelrothschild.com/personal/art/) and being outdoors. Aside from English, my French is B2/C1, and I am a habitual but poor student of  German & Swedish -- both are A2 at best; these are [CEFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages) scores. Delays in email responses may be related to [observances](https://isitajewishholidaytoday.com/), otherwise feel free to ping me again ;)
