I've been been privileged to be a computer science peer educator in a few forms. While teaching, I am concerned with helping students both learn the subject material and build their self confidence as a programmer or computer scientist. I'm interested in fostering inclusive learning spaces for all students and I am always excited to learn more about what other educators and students have found useful or important in this regard.

* __Teaching Assistant__ for CS 4001: Computing, Society, and Professionalism at Georgia Tech, Spring 2021. I was the recitation leader for two discussion sections (~10 students each) for this required course the for Georgia Tech undergraduate computing degree. Responsible for leading discussion, grading, and assisting students' development as writers and communicators of sociotechnical material.

* __Supplemental Instruction Leader__ for Data Structures (CS230) at Wellesley for four semesters (class enrollment size ranging from 25 to 60 college students). This role is much like that of a recitation leader; I provided two sessions per week for students to review lecture material and created worksheets to aid in this process. Please feel free to use the [worksheets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AqZUX2DnbirPe9qpzD7cOz8_-1nohemv?usp=sharing), just request Google Drive access. Please note that I often adapt/reuse selected problems from previous Wellesley SIs and credit should frequently be directed to them as noted in worksheet headers.

* __Lead Instructor__ for the forth-grade classroom of [Science Club for Girls](https://www.scienceclubforgirls.org/) (ten fourth graders) for one semester. I helped students learn the fundamentals of computing through Scratch Jr. and created activities to help my students see themselves as computer scientists.

* __Teaching Assistant__ for the [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) Summer Immersion Program in 2017 (38 students). Along with the lead teachers, I helped a group of students find their footing in various areas of computing, from Web development to robotics (Arduino).
